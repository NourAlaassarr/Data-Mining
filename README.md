# Data Mining

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of popular data mining algorithms: Apriori and K-Means clustering. These algorithms are widely used in various domains for extracting patterns and insights from datasets.

## Files
- **apriori_algo.py**: This file contains the implementation of the Apriori algorithm, a classic algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning.
- **kmeans_algo.py**: This file contains the implementation of the K-Means algorithm, a clustering technique used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subgroups.

## Usage
### Apriori Algorithm
To use the Apriori algorithm, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open BakeryApriori.py in your preferred Python environment.
3. Import the Apriori class from the file.
4. Import the Bakery.csv DataSet.
5. Instantiate the Apriori class with your dataset and minimum support threshold.
6. Retrieve the frequent itemsets and association rules using the appropriate methods.

### K-Means Algorithm
To use the K-Means algorithm, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open Movies.py in your preferred Python environment.
3. Import the KMeans class from the file.
4. Import the imdb_top_2000_movies.csv DataSet.
5. Instantiate the KMeans class with your dataset and the desired number of clusters (K).
6. Retrieve the cluster centroids and labels using the appropriate attributes.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
